# Entities

Entities are the core objects in the Knowledge Graph: companies, people, organizations, products, and other named things that appear in the news. Each entity has a unique **Named Entity ID (NEID)**.

NEIDs are stable and can be persisted long-term, but may occasionally change if the database is rebuilt or the application switches databases. When an NEID becomes invalid (e.g., resolution returns no results), re-resolve the entity using its canonical name from the previous query result, then redo any downstream operations that depended on it. NEIDs should NEVER be hardcoded in source code.

**Looking for property-based search?** To search for entities by type, property values, or relationships using the expression language, see [find.md](find.md).

## When to Use

- You have an entity name and need to find its NEID
- You have a NEID and need the entity's display name or details
- You're starting a new query and need to identify the subject
- You need entity metadata (industry, location, ticker, etc.)

## Key Concepts

- **NEID**: A unique identifier for each entity. Required for most other API calls.
  - Format: 20-character numeric string with zero-padding
  - Example: `00416400910670863867`
  - Always pad with leading zeros to exactly 20 characters when normalizing
- **EID**: The term EID is sometimes used interchangeably with NEID.
- **nindex**: The term nindex is sometimes used interchangeably with NEID.
- **Entity Resolution**: The same real-world entity may have multiple names (e.g., "Apple", "Apple Inc.", "AAPL"). The API resolves these to a single NEID.
- **Flavors (Entity Types)**: Each entity has a type identified by a Flavor ID (FID).

## Tips

- Always start by searching for the entity to get the correct NEID
- After resolving an entity to an NEID, save and use the the canonical entity name going forward.
- It's typically safe to resolve an entity to the top matching NEID. However, sometimes a useful pattern is to let the user give input that the resolution was incorrect, show them a longer list of matches, and let them choose a different resolution.
- Entity names are case-insensitive

## Key Endpoints

| What you need | Endpoint | Returns |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Find entity by name (batch, scored) | `POST /entities/search` | Ranked matches with NEIDs and scores |
| Get entity display name | `GET /entities/{neid}/name` | Canonical name (`{"name": "..."}`) |
| Get entity aliases | `GET /entities/{neid}/aliases` | All known names (`{"aliases": [...]}`) |
| Batch name lookup | `POST /entities/names` | Map of NEID → name |
| Batch alias lookup | `POST /entities/aliases` | Map of NEID → aliases |
| Resolve merged entities | `POST /entities/redirect` | Canonical NEIDs for merges |
| Full property values | `POST /elemental/entities/properties` | All properties with PIDs, values, timestamps |

## Form-Encoded JSON Parameters

Several Elemental API endpoints use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with
JSON-encoded values inside form fields. The `eids` and `pids` parameters on
`POST /elemental/entities/properties` are the most common example:

```
eids=["00416400910670863867","03016672914748108965"]&pids=[8,22]
```

The generated TypeScript client types show `eids: string` and `pids: string`
(not `string[]`) because the values are **JSON-stringified arrays passed as
strings**, not native arrays. When calling these endpoints:

```typescript
// Correct — JSON-stringify the arrays
eids: JSON.stringify(["00416400910670863867"])
pids: JSON.stringify([8, 22])

// Wrong — passing raw arrays will not work
eids: ["00416400910670863867"]  // ❌ type error or silent failure
```

The same pattern applies to the `expression` parameter on `POST /elemental/find`.

## Schema and Property Lookup

For understanding entity types (flavors), properties, and the data model, see **schema.md**. You'll need the schema because many API responses return only FIDs and PIDs — use it to translate these to human-readable names.

## Properties Return Multiple Timestamped Values

`getPropertyValues` returns **all** recorded values for a property, not just the latest. A single entity and property (e.g. Apple's `company_cik`) may return dozens of rows with different `recorded_at` timestamps — one per filing or data ingestion event. For display, take the first (or latest) value and deduplicate by PID:

```typescript
const byPid = new Map<number, string>();
for (const v of values) {
    if (!byPid.has(v.pid)) byPid.set(v.pid, v.value);
}
```

As an alternative, scope the request itself with `start_time` / `end_time`
(both RFC3339). Supplying a narrow time window lets the server filter
server-side so the client does not have to dedupe or post-filter a long
history.

## Relationship Properties and `recorded_at`

Relationship properties (e.g. `is_officer`, `is_director`, `works_at`) store the target entity's NEID in the `value` field. Like all property values, each row carries a `recorded_at` timestamp indicating when the relationship was observed in a filing or data source. A single relationship PID on one entity may return many rows — one per observation event — each with its own `recorded_at`.

These timestamps are *observation dates*, not exact start or end dates for the relationship. They indicate when a data source recorded the link, which may not correspond to when the relationship actually began or ended.

## `include_attributes` Parameter

`getPropertyValues` accepts an `include_attributes` parameter (set to `'true'` as a string) that returns additional metadata on each value. This is essential for relationship properties like `appears_in`, where attributes carry entity-level sentiment scores and article URLs.

**Note:** The generated TypeScript client types don't include `include_attributes` in the parameter type. Pass it as an extra property — the API accepts it:

```typescript
const res = await client.getPropertyValues({
    eids: JSON.stringify([neid]),
    pids: JSON.stringify([appearsInPid]),
    include_attributes: 'true',  // Not in TS types, but API accepts it
} as any);
```

**Important:** Attribute keys are **quad attribute type IDs (AIDs)**, NOT property PIDs. These are a separate numeric namespace. For example, property PID 15 is "industry", but attribute key "15" is "sentiment". To resolve attribute keys to names, use the `attributes` array from `GET /schema` (see schema.md).
