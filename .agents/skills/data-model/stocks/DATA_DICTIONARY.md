# Data Dictionary: Alpha Vantage Stocks

## Source Overview

Alpha Vantage stock market data via the `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` and `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY` REST APIs. Provides daily and 15-minute OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) candlestick data for US-listed equities on NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges.

Historical data uses daily candles: `outputsize=full` (20+ years) for initial backfill, `outputsize=compact` (last 100 trading days) for incremental catch-ups. Current-day data uses intraday candles at 15-minute intervals (15-min delayed). The streamer automatically handles both: daily backfill when needed, plus intraday polling every 15 minutes.

Symbol universe: ~6,900 tickers (after filtering preferred stock symbols) sourced from the NASDAQ screener (static CSV, downloaded 2026-03-13). Symbols containing `^` (preferred shares) are excluded because Alpha Vantage does not support them.

Rate limit: 1,200 requests/minute (premium plan). Downloads run concurrently (10 workers) with the Alpha Vantage client rate limiter gating throughput.

### `financial_instrument`

A publicly traded equity security (common stock, preferred stock, ETF, etc.) listed on a US exchange.

- Primary key: `ticker_symbol` (e.g., `"AAPL"`, `"IBM"`, `"BRK-B"`)
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `ticker_symbol`.
- Entity name: ticker symbol (e.g., `"AAPL"`).

### `organization`

A company or entity whose equity securities are publicly traded on a US exchange.

- Primary key: none (resolved by name).
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable.
- Entity name: full security name from the NASDAQ screener CSV (e.g., `"Apple Inc. Common Stock"`).
- Note: for dual-class shares (e.g., GOOGL and GOOG), separate organization entities are created per share class. Entity resolution may merge these with organizations from other sources (e.g., EDGAR).

## Notes

- **Timestamps**: Alpha Vantage returns timestamps in US/Eastern time. All atom timestamps are converted to UTC before storage.
- **Adjusted prices**: The daily endpoint returns raw (as-traded) prices. Split/dividend-adjusted data is available via `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` (premium) but is not currently used.
- **Missing data**: Not all symbols have data for all dates. Candles only exist for days with trading activity.
- **Streaming model**: HandleStream runs as a unified polling loop (default: every 15 minutes). First run downloads full daily history (`outputsize=full`) plus current-day intraday data. Subsequent runs download compact daily data once per day to catch yesterday's close, then poll intraday data every 15 minutes. Only candles newer than the checkpoint are atomized.
- **Preferred stock symbols**: Tickers containing `^` (e.g., `AHT^F`, `F^C`) are filtered out during symbol loading because Alpha Vantage returns empty responses for them.
