# Data Dictionary: EDGAR

## Source Overview

SEC EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) filings via two pipelines:
- **Company facts / XBRL**: structured financial data from `companyfacts.zip` and `submissions.zip` bulk APIs
- **Form parsing**: regulatory forms (10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, 8-K, Form 3/4, SC 13D/G, 13F-HR, DEF 14A) parsed from HTML, XML, and SGML documents

Financial figures from XBRL may be computed fallbacks when a company does not file the authoritative tag. Not all companies report all fields.

| Pipeline | `Record.Source` |

| 10-K annual report | `edgar_10k` |
| 10-Q quarterly report | `edgar_10q` |
| 20-F foreign issuer annual report | `edgar_20f` |
| 8-K current report | `edgar_8k` |
| Form 3 initial ownership | `edgar_3` |

## Entity Types

### `organization`

A public company, institutional investor, or corporate filer registered with the SEC.

- Primary key: `company_cik` (10-digit zero-padded CIK)
- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `company_cik`. Disambiguation via company name, city, state, SIC description, EIN. Ticker and former names as aliases.
- Financial metrics from XBRL are dual-homed on both the filing document and the organization, with a `filing_period` attribute (`FY`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`) to distinguish annual from quarterly values.

### SEC Filing Types (namespace: `sec`)

Each SEC form type is a separate flavor, namespaced under `sec`. All share the same strong ID (`accession_number`) and are not mergeable.

| Flavor | Display Name | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `sec::10_k` | 10-K | Annual report |
| `sec::10_q` | 10-Q | Quarterly report |
| `sec::20_f` | 20-F | Foreign private issuer annual report |
| `sec::8_k` | 8-K | Current report (material events) |
| `sec::form_3` | Form 3 | Initial statement of beneficial ownership |
| `sec::form_4` | Form 4 | Statement of changes in beneficial ownership |
| `sec::sc_13d` | SC 13D | Beneficial ownership report (activist) |
| `sec::sc_13g` | SC 13G | Beneficial ownership report (passive) |
| `sec::13f_hr` | 13F-HR | Institutional investment manager holdings |
| `sec::def_14a` | DEF 14A | Definitive proxy statement |
| `sec::s_4` | S-4 | Registration statement for securities issued in business combinations (mergers, acquisitions, exchange offers). Heuristic extraction of acquisition target, target legal counsel, and M&A classification. |
| `sec::6_k` | 6-K | Foreign private issuer current report (XBRL only, no form download) |
| `sec::40_f` | 40-F | Canadian cross-border annual report (XBRL only, no form download) |
| `sec::filing` | SEC Filing | Generic filing — defined in `schema.yaml` but **never produced**: `SecFormFlavor()` returns `""` for unmodeled forms, causing them to be skipped in `AtomizeFilingsV2` |

### `industry`

A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) category assigned by the SEC.

- Primary key: `sic_code`
- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `sic_code`.

### Sub-Records (8-K Events, Form 4 Transactions, Form 3 Holdings)

Sub-records are **separate graph entities**, not nested properties on the parent filing. Each sub-record has its own NEID and can be queried independently. They use the same flavor as their parent filing (e.g., `sec::8_k` for 8-K events, `sec::form_4` for Form 4 transactions).

**Entity naming pattern:**
- 8-K events: `{accession_number}_evt_{n}` (e.g., `0000320193-24-000067_evt_1`)
- Form 4 transactions: `{accession_number}_trx_{n}` (e.g., `0000320193-24-000067_trx_1`)
- Form 3 holdings: `{accession_number}_holding_{n}`

**Relationships on sub-records:**
- `filed` — points to the parent filing's accession number
- `issued_by` — points to the company

**Critical querying note:** Properties like `form_8k_event`, `form_8k_item_code`, `transaction_type`, `shares_transacted`, and other sub-record-specific properties do NOT appear on the parent filing entity or the organization entity. You must traverse the graph to the sub-record entities to access them.

**Traversal path:**
```
organization --[filed]--> 8-K filing --[linked, distance 1]--> event sub-records
```

**Example: Finding 8-K event sub-records for a company:**
1. Get filing NEIDs from the organization's `filed` property
2. Filter to 8-K filings by checking `form_type == "8-K"`
3. For each 8-K filing, use a `linked` expression (distance 1, direction both) to find connected entities
4. Exclude the organization and the filing itself from results — the remaining entities are the event sub-records
5. Query those sub-record NEIDs for `form_8k_event` and `form_8k_item_code`

### `person`

A corporate insider (officer, director, or significant owner) from Form 3 or Form 4.

- Primary key: `person_cik` when available; otherwise named entity resolution.
- Entity resolver: named entity, not mergeable. Strong ID = `person_cik` when present.

### `financial_instrument`

A tradeable security identified by CUSIP, from 13F-HR filings.

- Primary key: `cusip_number`
- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `cusip_number`.

## Entity Relationships

> **Sub-record traversal:** Sub-records (8-K events, Form 4 transactions, Form 3 holdings) are separate document entities. To find them, traverse from the parent filing using a `linked` expression (distance 1). The sub-record's `filed` property points back to the parent filing, and `issued_by` points to the company.
